# Motion-Compensated-Pulse-Rate-Estimation
Created pulse rate algorithm that takes into account activity &amp; determines clinically significant features


Build a pulse rate algorithm from the given dataset containing PPG and IMU signals that is robust to motion and "confidence metric" that estimates the accuracy of their pulse rate estimate. Then apply your algorithm to a new dataset to find more clinically meaningful features.
